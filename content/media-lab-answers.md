## Interest In App Inventor

I like building [teaching aids][1] and [self-learning tools][2], with the 
broader goal of pursuing [domain-specific compilers][3]. I also have
a keen interest in developing natural programming methods for 
the blind. To me, the App Inventor is the most motivating example towards 
both an alternative way to program and blocks-to-binary alchemy.

## Interest In Introductory Programming

As a Google-funded TA, I held [classes and laboratory sessions][4] for
the first course on Android application development at my university.
As a TA for the MIT Indian Mobile Initiative, I taught Android development
to students from across the India.

## Proposed Summer Project

I would like to build a sensor input data framework that allows users
to collect streaming sensor data from the phone. I would also like to
build a custom emulator system.img that listens for sensor data on sockets,
to enable the emulator to function with the OpenIntents sensor simulator, or
any device or application that can send data to the emulator socket.
