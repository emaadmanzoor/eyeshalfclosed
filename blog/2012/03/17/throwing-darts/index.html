<p>This weekend was illuminating. We'd been assigned the task
of building a compute cluster, with the freedom to intelligently
choose every component of the distributed system. This post documents
the how's and why's of building the system from the ground up with
<a href="https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd">Beanstalkd</a> and running Python code to estimate π in parallel.</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<ul>
<li> We used <a href="https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd">Beanstalkd</a> for our message queue.</li>
<li> We used <a href="https://github.com/earl/beanstalkc">Beanstalkc</a> for Python bindings.</li>
<li> Our system is <em>fully worker-fault-tolerant</em>.</li>
<li> Our system is <em>partially server-fault-tolerant</em>.</li>

<h2>Purpose And Background</h2>

<h3>The Purpose</h3>

<p>The aim was to construct something reasonably fault tolerant that could
execute simple parallel algorithms across a bunch of nodes, with a
visible speed-up. Other motivations were to put together a system
that could serve as a useful pedagogical tool for a parallel computing
course, and to replace the cranky old Rocks cluster we currently tinker
around with, with something more fun.</p>

<p><strong>The Beef With MPICH</strong></p>

<p>We began our experiments with <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich1-old">MPICH</a>, which seems to be the
de facto standard for expressing parallel algorithms in code. We spent
most of the day getting our nodes to talk to each other via SSH, which
involved creating new users on each node, authorizing keys and a bunch
of other annoying things that clutter your nodes up pretty bad.</p>

<p>Writing code the MPICH way is reminiscent of the fork() and PID-check pattern
we use in single-node multi-process code. Each MPICH program is
(from our experience) a single C file, with logic for the master interleaved
with the logic for each worker node amongst a tangled net of <em>if-PID-equals-me</em>
conditions. Node failure was another animal, causing the entire program
to stall indefinitely until the node was put back into action.</p>

<p>This was frustrating. Much thought went into understanding the flow of
logic and the usual fight with C's idiosyncracies. Further, the idea
of remotely executing multiple copies of the same binary and then
collecting the results seemed suitable for short-running programs on
well-behaved hardware, a luxury we didn't have.</p>

<p>We preferred something lazy, something more fluid. We wanted our workers
to sit around on all nodes waiting for jobs to do. We wanted both our master
and our workers to know only about the work that needs done, so they can
be independently coded, debugged, tested and optimized.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Message Queues</strong></p>

<p>The concept is simple to grasp; a set of distributed FIFO queues accessible
via TCP sockets. Producers push to the queue and consumers pull from the queue,
with queue elements being any arbitrary data. The confusion begins when you sit
down to evaluate the whole slew of message queueing solutions buzzing around
the web these days.</p>

<p><em>RabbitMQ</em> and <em>ZeroMQ</em> are probably the first options you'd come across. While
very popular and performant, they are generic message queues. Our task
involved a special subset of what a queue could serve, that of job queueing.
We needed a mechanism to farm out jobs to workers, monitor their progress
and do the necessary cleanup if a worker failed to perform. While we could
build this functionality on top of a generic queueing solution, we weren't
up for reinventing the wheel just yet.</p>

<p><em>Celery</em> was one such specialized solution, but at first glance, seemed to be
heavily tied in to Django applications. <em>Gearman</em> was another that seemed
seductively convenient; it brought with it an entire framework to farm out
jobs, persist queues, accomodate job server failure and the works, but we
decided to let it pass for something lighter until we figured out our own
needs.</p>

<p><em>Beanstalkd</em> fit the bill perfectly. It's the lightest work-queue solution
we could find that supported some form of queue persistence and worker failure
recovery. To top that off, getting a working Beanstalkd setup took all of
ten minutes!</p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Nodes</h2>

<p><strong>Prepare The Ingredients</strong></p>

<p>You'll need to give the following some space on your local drive before
we start doing anything cool:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>python-setuptools</em> or <em>python-distribute</em>: A bunch of utility scripts
 to install Python modules; available via your package manager.</li>
<li> <em>Beanstalkd</em>: The Beanstalk queue server; <a href="http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/download.html">download methods</a>
 exist for most package managers, but I'd recommend cloning the most recent version from
 the <a href="http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd">source at Github</a>.</li>
<li> <em>Beanstalkc</em>: Python bindings for Beanstalkd; you'll need to get
 this from the <a href="https://github.com/earl/beanstalkc">source</a>
</li>
<li> <em>python-yaml</em> or <em>pyYAML</em>: Python libraries to parse YAML matter;
 available via your package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beanstalkd</strong></p>

<p>If you've installed Beanstalkd using your package manager, you won't need
to compile the sources. If not, you'll need to change into the source directory to
compile the source and run tests:</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  $ make
  $ ./check.sh</pre>


<p>Run the Beanstalk server on port 11300 (this is arbitrary) on your local host:</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  $ beanstalkd -l 127.0.0.1 -p 11300</pre>


<p><strong>Beanstalkc</strong></p>

<p>You'll just need to switch to the Beanstalkc source directory and run the
provided install script:</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  $ sudo python setup.py install</pre>


<p><strong>Testing The Combination</strong></p>

<p>Fire up your Python REPL and mimic the statement flow in the listing below:</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  <span class="Keyword">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="Keyword">import</span> beanstalkc
  <span class="Keyword">&gt;&gt;</span> bean <span class="Keyword">=</span> beanstalkc.Connection(<span class="Variable">host</span><span class="Keyword">=</span><span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>127.0.0.1<span class="String">'</span></span>, <span class="Variable">port</span><span class="Keyword">=</span><span class="Constant">11300</span>)
  <span class="Keyword">&gt;&gt;</span> bean.put(<span class="String"><span class="String">'</span>Lala<span class="String">'</span></span>) 
  <span class="Constant">1</span>
  <span class="Keyword">&gt;&gt;</span> job <span class="Keyword">=</span> bean.reserve()
  <span class="Constant">1</span>
  <span class="Keyword">&gt;&gt;</span> job.body
  Lala
  <span class="Keyword">&gt;&gt;</span> job.delete()</pre>


<p>That's it, you've just created your first distributed task queue! The listing
above created a connection to the queue and added a new task; tasks in Beanstalkd
are always strings, any non-string data you send across must be serialized. We
then <em>reserve</em> a job from the queue, which is worker-slang for <em>"I'll work on this
right now!"</em>. Once you've reserved your job, you can retrieve its <em>body</em> and
pretend to do some work on it. When you're finished, you need to notify the
Beanstalkd server by <em>deleting</em> the job from the queue. If a worker fails to
delete a job, the worker is forsaken and its job is placed back onto the
tail of the queue after a specified time interval.</p>

<h2>Writing Some Code </h2>

<p><strong>The Algorithm</strong></p>

<p><img src="pi-monte-carlo-algorithm.gif" title="Estimating Pi by a Monte-Carlo algorithm"></p>

<p>The code for the algorithm was derived from that presented in <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/parallel_comp/#ExamplesPI">Introduction to Parallel Computing</a>.
It turns out to be embarassingly parallel, and hence, easily implementable in a master-worker setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The master allocates to each worker the number of points to generate within the square.
 The number of points is derived simply be splitting the total number of points we desire
 among the number of workers we expect to have. More points lead to more accurate estimation.</p></li>
<li><p>The worker receives the number of points it must generate from the master, and then generates
   those points, or throws those darts into the square. It calculates the number of darts that land
   within the circle and returns the ratio of that to the total number of darts back to the master.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>System Design</strong></p>

<p><img src="system-design.jpg" title="System design"></p>

<p>The system follows a simple producer-consumer model. There are two queues; the one that the
master <em>M</em> pushes to and workers consume from is called <em>message-for-worker</em>, and the one that
the workers push to and the master consumes from is called <em>message-for-client</em>.</p>

<p><em>M</em> accepts as a parameter <em>N</em> the number of darts to throw, and <em>W</em> as the
number of workers it can expect to be active. It then splits the <em>N</em> darts equally among <em>W</em>
workers and pushes each worker's quota to <em>message-for-worker</em>.</p>

<p>Each worker consumes a single item <em>k</em> from <em>message-for-worker</em> and performs <em>f(k)</em>: throwing
<em>k</em> darts into the square and then counting the number of darts <em>P<sub>i</sub></em> falling within
the circle. Each worker pushes its <em>P<sub>i</sub></em> to <em>message-for-client</em>.</p>

<p>The master waits for all workers to complete, and then sums all the workers' responses in
<em>message-for-client</em>, divides by the total number of darts <em>N</em> and multiplies the resultant
by four to get the estimated value of π.</p>

<p><strong>The Client Code</strong></p>

<p><em>The complete and most recent code can be retrieved from the <a href="https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/distributed-pi-estimation/">source</a></em></p>

<p>The client code is easy to grok after having understood the algorithm it expresses and
having read the <a href="https://github.com/earl/beanstalkc/blob/master/TUTORIAL.mkd">Beanstalkc tutorial</a>. The comments serve as pointers to Beanstalkd
concepts that I've not explained in the prior sections</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  <span class="Keyword">import</span> beanstalkc

  QUEUE_TO_IGNORE <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>default<span class="String">"</span></span></pre>


<p>This binds variables to the names of our queues for convenience. <em>default</em> is a queue that
is created by default by the Beanstalkd server, it would do us good to ignore it.</p>

<pre class="sunburst">

  beanstalk.use(QUEUE_TO_USE)
  beanstalk.watch(QUEUE_TO_WATCH)
  beanstalk.ignore(QUEUE_TO_IGNORE)</pre>


<p>The first triplet of lines is something you'll need to be aware of and adapt to your
scenario. <em>N</em> is the total number of darts to throw, and directly affects the accuracy
of your estimate and the computing power required. <em>K</em> needs to be set equal to the
number of worker nodes you expect to see active. Leaving these unchanged won't break
any functionality, but it will leave you taking long coffee breaks until you see any
meaningful results.</p>

<p>It also tells the Beanstalkd server which queues to <em>watch</em>, or consume from, <em>use</em>,
or push to, and <em>ignore</em>, which takes on its literal meaning this time.</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  use_queue_was_full <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Constant">False</span>
  <span class="Keyword">while</span> <span class="Constant">True</span>:  <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">#</span> Block until the queue we push to is empty</span>
      <span class="Keyword">if</span> (beanstalk.stats_tube(QUEUE_TO_USE)[<span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>current-jobs-ready<span class="String">"</span></span>]

<p>This segment of code enables <a href="#fault-tolerance">server fault tolerance</a>, which we discuss

<p>This segment pushes the worker quotas to the queue and waits for results. On
receiving results, it accumulates them in a variable and then closes the connection
to Beanstalkd.</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  pi <span class="Keyword">=</span> (<span class="Constant">4.0</span> <span class="Keyword">*</span> total_count) <span class="Keyword">/</span> (responses_received <span class="Keyword">*</span> points_per_job)

<p>This uses the accumulated sum of the circle counts returned by the workers to
compute the estimated value of π, in accordance with the algorithm described earlier.</p>

<p><strong>The Worker Code</strong></p>

<p><em>The complete and most recent code can be retrieved from the <a href="https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/distributed-pi-estimation/">source</a></em></p>

<p>The worker code simply implements the algorithm in the context of the system, both of which
have been described above. Most of the boilerplate matches that in the client, the differences
have been briefly summarized below:n</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  <span class="Keyword">while</span> <span class="Constant">True</span>:                             <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">#</span> Indefinitely wait for jobs to do</span>

<p>This makes our worker a <em>daemon</em> of sorts; it sits around indefinitely, waiting for jobs to
do, and on completion of a job, goes back to waiting for the next job to work on.</p>

<p>This simply implements the estimation algorithm discussed in an earlier section.
The result of the algorithm is pushed to <em>QUEUE_TO_USE</em> by the worker.</p>

<p><strong>Blast Off</strong></p>

<p>Getting the code running involves simply running the worker Python script on a number
of terminals to spawn as many workers as you need, and then starting the client Python
code to farm out jobs to the workers. If you're attempting this in a distributed setup,
ensure you make the necessary modifications in the server address and port.</p>

<h2>Getting Fault Tolerant</h2>

<p><strong>Worker Fault Tolerance</strong></p>

<p>Worker fault tolerance is baked in to the Beanstalkd architecture. Workers work on
jobs from the queue by <em>reserving</em> them. On completion, they are expected to <em>delete</em>
the job from the queue, which is a way of notifying the server that it has completed
its job. If, however, a worker fails to <em>delete</em> a job within a configurable time
interval <em>TTR</em>, the job is re-added to the tail of the queue. Thus, in the worst case
when all but one worker fail, the single worker will sequentially consume and work
on all the items in its queue.</p>

<p><strong>Server Fault Tolerance</strong></p>

<p>To provide some form of persistence for the in-memory queue, Beanstalkd supports an
option called <em>binlog</em>. Enabled with the <em>b <directory></directory></em> option to the Beanstalkd
executable, this periodically stores the state of the queue to a flat file in the
directory specified. On restarting from server failure with the <em>-b</em> switch, the
in-memory queue is reconstructed from the files in this directory.</p>

<p>However, to take advantage of server restarts and the <em>binlog</em>, the client code will
need to be augmented with some failure-resume intelligence. In particular, the client
must not re-push data into its queue if there exist items remaining from before the
server failed. This is enabled with this bit of code in the client:</p>

<pre class="sunburst">
  use_queue_was_full <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Constant">False</span>
  <span class="Keyword">while</span> <span class="Constant">True</span>:  <span class="Comment"><span class="Comment">#</span> Block until the queue we push to is empty</span>
      <span class="Keyword">if</span> (beanstalk.stats_tube(QUEUE_TO_USE)[<span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>current-jobs-ready<span class="String">"</span></span>]
          <span class="Keyword">+</span> beanstalk.stats_tube(QUEUE_TO_USE)[<span class="String"><span class="String">"</span>current-jobs-reserved<span class="String">"</span></span>]) <span class="Keyword">==</span> <span class="Constant">0</span>:
          <span class="Keyword">break</span>
      <span class="Keyword">else</span>:
          use_queue_was_full <span class="Keyword">=</span> <span class="Constant">True</span> </pre>


<p>This uses Beanstalkd's statistics queries to gain information about the number of items
in the queue it's pushing to. Until that queue is empty, it blocks and waits.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<p>I can't help reflecting on how difficult it was to predict when our nodes
would turn nasty. Even though we were looking through layers of well organized
cellophane; our <a href="https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/distributed-pi-estimation/">own code</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd">minimalistic backbone</a> and simple socket IO.</p>

<p>What if, instead, we were obliged to build an underground piping system
for drinking water? With no web interface to monitor leaky hardware, no Nagios
alerts when rodent miscreants chew threw your valves, and misbehaving pipes
occasionally sharing their contents, causing much bowel discomfort for the
townspeople.</p>

<p>Not to mention you'd have to dig up a lot of mud to fix things.</p>
